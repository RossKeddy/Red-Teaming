# XXE

Some web applications handle data and rely on the XML format to exchange data with the browsers.

> XXE vulnerabilities arise because the XML specification contains various potentially dangerous features, and standard parsers support these features even if they are not normally used by the application.
> 
> XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data ([portswigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe)).

XXE injections can sometimes lead toÂ SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery), Local File Disclosure, Sensitive Information Disclosure, Data Exfiltration, RCE (Remote Code Execution) and so on.
