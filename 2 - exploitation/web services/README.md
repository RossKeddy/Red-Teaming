# Web Exploitation
https://owasp.org/Top10/

The¬†[OWASP Top 10](https://www.f5.com/cloud/resources/videos)¬†web application security risks for 2021 are:
- **A01¬†- Broken Access Control**: This risk involves flaws that allow attackers to bypass authorization and access or modify data and functionalities they should not have access to. It is the most critical risk, with 3.81% of applications tested having one or more Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) in this category.
    
- **A02¬†- Cryptographic Failures**: Previously known as "Sensitive Data Exposure," this risk involves the failure to protect sensitive data such as financial information and passwords. Proper encryption and secure handling of data are essential to mitigate this risk.
    
- **A03¬†- Injection**: Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. SQL injection, command injection, and other forms of injection can lead to data loss, data corruption, and even complete system compromise.
    
- **A04¬†- Insecure Design**: This category focuses on fundamental design flaws and ineffective controls. It emphasizes the importance of secure design practices, including threat modeling and the use of secure design patterns.
    
- **A05¬†- Security Misconfiguration**: This risk involves the incorrect configuration of security settings, such as leaving default configurations unchanged, displaying overly verbose error messages, and using insecure default values. Regularly reviewing and updating configurations is crucial to mitigate this risk.
    
- **A06¬†- Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: Using components with known vulnerabilities can expose applications to attacks. Developers should regularly update and patch components to ensure they are secure.
    
- **A07¬†- Identification and Authentication Failures**: Weaknesses in authentication and session management can allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens. Implementing strong authentication mechanisms and secure session management practices is essential.
    
- **A08¬†- Software and Data Integrity Failures**: This risk involves the failure to verify the integrity of software and data, leading to potential tampering and supply chain attacks. Ensuring the integrity of software and data is crucial to prevent such attacks.
    
- **A09¬†- Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Insufficient logging and monitoring can allow attackers to remain undetected. Implementing robust logging and monitoring practices helps detect and respond to security incidents.
    
- **A10¬†- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: SSRF flaws occur when an application fetches a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URI. This can allow attackers to send crafted requests to unexpected destinations, potentially leading to data exfiltration or other security issues.

### ü•∑ **Sniper**

**Use case**: Test one payload position at a time, especially useful for parameter fuzzing or input validation testing.

**Benefits**:
- **Ideal for finding single-point vulnerabilities**, like XSS, SQLi, or open redirects.
- **Only one payload set needed**, making it simple to configure.
- Good for **error-based testing** where you're monitoring server behavior when a single input is changed.
- Less noisy, **fewer requests** than multi-parameter attacks

**Example**: Testing each parameter individually for SQL injection payloads.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Battering Ram**
**Use case**: Sends the same payload to all payload positions in each request.

**Benefits**:

- Fast and simple when the **same value needs to be tested across multiple parameters**.
- Useful for detecting **duplicate input vulnerabilities** like password confirmation or token reuse.
- Efficient for testing **authentication bypasses** where multiple parameters (e.g., username and email) must match.

**Example**: Checking if setting all fields to `' OR 1=1--` causes an authentication bypass.

---
### üéõÔ∏è **Pitchfork**

**Use case**: Uses **multiple payload sets**, one per position, and sends each set in lockstep.

**Benefits**:
- Good for testing **credentials (username/password) or key/value pairs**.
- Ideal for **combinations where the values must align**, e.g., testing usernames and matching passwords.
- Useful for **parallel brute-force** attempts on multiple fields.

**Example**: Trying `admin:admin`, `user:user`, etc., by aligning usernames and passwords.

---

### üí£ **Cluster Bomb**

**Use case**: Uses multiple payload sets and generates **all possible combinations**.

**Benefits**:
- Most powerful for **combinatorial testing** (cross-pairing all payloads).
- Essential when **interactions between multiple parameters** might cause vulnerabilities.
- Great for discovering **logical flaws**, like privilege escalation or bypasses that require a specific combination of values.

**Example**: Finding an access control issue by testing different roles with different actions.
