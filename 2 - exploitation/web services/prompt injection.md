# Prompt Injection

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large language models are the basis of many current AI systems. They are trained on massive collections of text and code, which allows them to produce human-like answers, summaries, and even generate programs or stories.

LLMs have restrictions that prevent them from going beyond their built-in abilities, which limits them. They cannot act outside their text box, and their training only lasts up to a certain point in time. Because of this, they may invent facts, miss recent events, or fail at tasks that require real-world actions.

Some of the main traits of LLMs are:

- Text generation: They predict the next word step by step to form complete responses.
- Stored knowledge: They hold a wide range of information from training data.
- Follow instructions: They can be tuned to follow prompts in ways closer to what people expect.

Since LLMs mainly follow text patterns, they can be tricked. Common risks include prompt injection, jailbreaking, and data poisoning, where attackers shape prompts or data to force the model to produce unsafe or unintended results.

These gaps in control explain why the next step was to move towards agentic AI, where LLMs are given the ability to plan, act, and interact with the outside world.

## Agentic AI

As mentioned, agentic AI refers to AI with agency capabilities, meaning that they are not restricted by narrow instructions, but rather capable of acting to accomplish a goal with minimal supervision. For example, an agentic AI will try to:

- Plan multi-step plans to accomplish goals.
- Act on things (run tools, call APIs, copy files).
- Watch & adapt, adapting strategy when things fail or new knowledge is discovered.

## ReAct Prompting & Context-Awareness

All that was mentioned is possible due to the fact that agentic AI uses  chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve its ability to perform complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. CoT is a prompt-engineering method designed to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially for tasks that require complex, multi-step thinking. The chain-of-thought (CoT) handles the execution of complex reasoning tasks through intermediate reasoning steps.

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting demonstrated that large language models can generate explicit reasoning traces to solve tasks requiring arithmetic, logic, and common-sense reasoning. However, CoT has a critical limitation: because it operates in isolation, without access to external knowledge or tools, it often suffers from fact hallucination, outdated knowledge, and error propagation.

ReAct (Reason + Act) addresses this limitation by unifying reasoning and acting within the same framework. Instead of producing only an answer or a reasoning trace, a ReAct-enabled LLM alternates between:

- Verbal reasoning traces: Articulating its current thought process.
- Actions: Executing operations in an external environment (e.g., searching Wikipedia, querying an API, or running code).

This allows the model to:

- Dynamically plan and adapt: Updating its strategy as new observations come in.
- Ground reasoning in reality: Pulling in external knowledge to reduce hallucinations.
- Close the loop between thought and action: Much like humans, who reason about what to do, act, observe the outcome, and refine their next steps.
