# Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Attacks
aka cPassword Attacks

GPP allowed admins to create policies using embedded credentials. These credentials were encrypted and placed in a "cPassword". The key was accidentally released in 2016 and was patched in MS14-025 but doesn't prevent previous uses.

Impacket has a great module for GPP attacks.
```bash
Get-GPPPassword.py DOMAIN/USER:Password@x.x.x.x
```

```powershell
gpp-decrypt $cpassword
```
