# (ESC2) Any Purpose EKU 

When a certificate template specifies the Any Purpose EKU, or no EKU at all, the certificate can be used for anything. ESC2 can't be abused like ESC1 if the requester can't specify a SAN, however, it can be abused like ESC3 to use the certificate as requirement to request another one on behalf of any user.
